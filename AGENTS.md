# AGENTS.md

This file provides guidance to AI coding agents when working with code in this repository.

## Project

Centrifuge Protocol documentation site, built with Docusaurus 3. Hosted at https://docs.centrifuge.io.

## Commands

```bash
pnpm install          # Install dependencies
pnpm start            # Dev server (port 3000)
pnpm build            # Production build to public/
pnpm typecheck        # TypeScript type checking
pnpm clear            # Clear Docusaurus cache
```

Node.js v20 (see .nvmrc). Minimum v18.

## Architecture

- **Docusaurus 3** with TypeScript config (`docusaurus.config.ts`)
- Docs served at root (`routeBasePath: "/"`)
- Three autogenerated sidebars from filesystem: `getting-started`, `user`, `developer` (see `sidebars.ts`)
- Sidebar ordering controlled by `_category_.yml` files (`position` field)
- URL redirects for legacy paths in `src/redirects.js`, used by `@docusaurus/plugin-client-redirects`
- Math support via remark-math + rehype-katex
- Solidity syntax highlighting enabled in Prism
- Algolia search integration
- Main branch: `main`

## Documentation pages

Each page is a markdown file with YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
---
id: page-id
title: Page title
category: subpage
contributors: <Name:email>
---
```

Pages are organized under `docs/` in three top-level sections: `getting-started/`, `user/`, `developer/`. Docusaurus admonitions (`:::info`, `:::warning`, etc.) are supported.

## Writing style

- Use sentence case for headings: "Technical architecture" not "Technical Architecture"
- Don't over-use bold text — use it sparingly for emphasis
- Short, high-signal sentences. Plain English over jargon
- Use active voice and "we" where appropriate
- Describe systems as operating, not as problems to be solved. Prefer "optimizing", "scaling", "standardizing" over "exploring", "testing", "experimenting"
- Avoid filler superlatives: "comprehensive", "cutting-edge", "revolutionary", "world-class", "industry-leading"
- No emoji in docs

## Terminology

- "onchain", "offchain", "multichain" (one word, no hyphen)
- "tokenized" not "tokenised" (US English)
- Centrifuge is a protocol / open infrastructure, not a chain or network
- Centrifuge provides technology rails — it does not originate loans, manage funds, or issue financial products
- Prefer "meets institutional requirements" over "compliant"
- Spell out acronyms on first mention (e.g. real-world assets), then use the short form (RWA). Don't write both together like "real-world assets (RWA)"
- Reference standards by name: ERC-7540, ERC-4626
- Tinlake and Centrifuge Chain are legacy — don't reference them as current products
