## About

Centrifuge is an open, decentralized operating system which provides a method to create, exchange, and use the data that is used in the financial supply chain. It creates transparent and shareable relationships between interacting companies.

This project documents the procedure to setup a Centrifuge Node. For the step by step procedure, see [Docs](https://developer.centrifuge.io/).

For information on the Centrifuge code, see our other repos.

### Images

Place all the static images under `docs/` folder close to the relevant content and
add the relative path of the image along with alt tag in the Markdown file like below

You can use styling attributes on images
