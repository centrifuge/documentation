# Contributing to Centrifuge Chain

The development of the Centrifuge Chain benefits greatly from the diverse perspectives and skills of our external contributors. Whether you are fixing a bug, proposing a new feature, or enhancing the existing documentation, your efforts are highly valued. Join us in further developing this open-source project by sharing your unique contributions.

A practical entry point for contributors is to address issues tagged as [Q0-trivial or Q1-easy](https://github.com/centrifuge/centrifuge-chain/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3AQ1-easy%2CQ0-trivial+). Making corrections to typos in our Rustdocs or inline comments is equally important and greatly appreciated.

The sections below provide guidance on compiling the repository, executing unit tests, operating a local chain, verifying proposed runtime versions, conducting benchmarks, and updating to newer versions of the Polkadot SDK.

## Build

Install [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install):

Initialize your Wasm Build environment:

```bash
./scripts/init.sh install-toolchain
```

Build Wasm and native code:

- Prerequisites : `cmake`, `libclang-dev`

```bash
cargo build --release
```

Great! You have already compiled the Centrifuge Chain!

## Tests

There are two kinds of tests, one related to how the _Centrifuge Chain_ works itself
and another one to verify how it works in a more real environment as a parachain.

### Chain tests

The following command will run the unit and integration tests:

```bash
cargo test --workspace --release --features runtime-benchmarks,try-runtime
```

### Environment tests

You can deploy a relay chain and connect a Centrifuge Chain node as parachain
to it to verify how it behaves in the entire environment (end-to-end).

0.  Prerequisites. You must install these tools before:

    - [docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
    - [_jd_](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/)

1.  Start a local [relay chain](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-architecture#relay-chain).
    It contains two [validator](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-validator) nodes
    (Alice and Bob):
    `bash
./scripts/init.sh start-relay-chain
`
    After a few seconds you can see the block production of the relay chain using the [polkadot.js (on localhost:9944)](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=ws%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3A9944#/explorer) client.

            *Note: You can stop the relay chain using `./scripts/init.sh stop-relay-chain`*

2.  Start a _Centrifuge Chain_ as [parachain](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-parachains).
    It runs a [collator](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-collator) node:
    `bash
./scripts/init.sh start-parachain
`
    _Note: the command above will show logs and block until the parachain is stopped.
    If you had a previous state, you can reset the node using `purge` after the command._

            Similar to the relay chain, you can explore the parachain using the [polkadot.js (on localhost:11936)](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=ws%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3A11936#/explorer) client.
            You will see the block production frozen until you connect it to the relay chain.

        By default, the initialized parachain will have the id `2000`.
        Please note that for ephemeral chains specs such as `development`, `centrifuge-local` or `altair-local`, the
        parachain ID is currently hardcoded.
        If you need to customize it, please open an issue and we will add such a feature.
        If choose other chain specifications, you can set the `PARA_CHAIN_SPEC` env var, e.g.:
        `bash

    PARA_CHAIN_SPEC=development ./scripts/init.sh start-parachain
    `    The different`PARA_CHAIN_SPEC` values can be found at [`src/command.rs`](https://github.com/centrifuge/centrifuge-chain/blob/main/node/src/command.rs) under the `load_spec()`
    function.

3.  Onboard the parachain
    This step will have the targeted parachain onboarded in the relay chain. The parachain will NOT produce blocks until this step is completed successfully.
    ```bash
    ./scripts/init.sh onboard-parachain
    ```
    When you have run the command, you should see in the relay-chain dashboard that there is a parachain
    that will be onboarded in one/two minutes.
    Once onboarded, block production should start soon after in the parachain.

That's all! The environment is set.
You can play with it from the parachain client, make transfers, inspect events, etc.

## Linting

### Source code

Lint the source code with `cargo fmt --all`. This excludes certain paths (defined in `rustfmt.toml`) that we want to stay as close as possible to `paritytech/substrate` to simplify upgrading to new releases.

### Cargo.toml files

1. Install [taplo](https://github.com/tamasfe/taplo) with `cargo install taplo-cli`.
2. Lint the `Cargo.toml` files with `taplo fmt`.

## Verifying Runtime

1. Check out the commit at which the runtime was built.
2. Build the WASM via `cargo build --release`
3. Ensure the output from [subwasm](https://github.com/chevdor/subwasm) matches the release one. Run `subwasm info ./target/release/wbuild/centrifuge-runtime/centrifuge_runtime.compact.compressed.wasm`, which creates an output like the following one:

```
üèãÔ∏è  Runtime size:             1.819 MB (1,906,886 bytes)
üóú  Compressed:               Yes, 78.50%

```

4. The `Blake2-256` hash should match the hex of the `authorizeUpgrade` call.

## Generate new Spec and Parachain files

This script will take a valid chain-spec chain_id and a flag to build new spec or not, and will output genesis spec (raw
and plain), wasm and state files.

```shell
./scripts/export_parachain_files.sh demo true
```

Adapt parameters accordingly.

## Benchmarking

### Benchmarking runtimes

When benchmarking pallets, we are just running the benchmarking scenarios they specify
within their mocked runtime. This fails to actually benchmark said pallet in the context
in which it will be actually used in production: within a specific runtime and composing
with other pallets.

To cover that, we run test for every pallet for a given runtime and use the output weights
in production since those are the most trustworthy weights we can use.

Note: This command should be run in a cloud environment that mimics closely the specs of
the collator node the parachain will be running on.

```shell
./scripts/runtime_benchmarks.sh <runtime>
```

## Updating to a newer version of Polkadot

When a new version of Polkadot is released, companion releases happen for the other
parity projects such as the Polkadot SDK, as well as for other third-party projects
such as the `ORML` pallets, `xcm-simulator`, etc.

Therefore, updating this repository to a new version of Polkadot means updating all of these dependencies
(internal and external to Centrifuge ) and have them all aligned on the same version of Polkadot.

_Note: When we say "new version of Polkadot", we implicitly mean "Polkadot SDK, Frontier, ORML"._

The high level flow to upgrade to a newer version of Polkadot is:

1. Update all the Centrifuge-Chain dependencies to a revision that also points to the last version of Polkadot
2. Fix all the breaking changes introduced by the latest versions

### Update dependencies

Since the Centrifuge Chain repository uses workspace inheritance, dependency revisions only need to be configured in the root `Cargo.toml`.

1. **Update the `patch` rules in `Cargo.toml`**

   The cargo patch rules ensure that we use specific revision for the Polkadot SDK, Frontier and others, by
   pointing to a specific git revision or branch. For each of the projects covered by these rules, look up whether there exists a git branch for the specific Polkadot SDK version to which you want to upgrade.

2. **Repeat step 1. for the other Centrifuge repositories that the Centrifuge Chain depends on**

   For each of those repositories, create a new branch out of the latest `polkadot-vX.Y.Z` and repeat step 1 for each of them.

   - [centrifuge/chainbridge-substrate](https://github.com/centrifuge/chainbridge-substrate)
   - [centrifuge/fudge](https://github.com/centrifuge/fudge)
   - [foss3/runtime-pallet-library](https://github.com/foss3/runtime-pallet-library)
   - [centrifuge/go-substrate-rpc-client](https://github.com/centrifuge/go-substrate-rpc-client)
     - NOTE: Only required in case of breaking client changes (i.e. deprecations or new host functions)

3. **Back to Centrifuge-chain, update the crates in the projects updated in step 2.**

   For example, if before we have a dependency on `fudge` at branch `polkadot-v1.1.1`, update it to `polkadot-v1.7.0`.

   Note: assuming `1.7.0` is the version we are updating to.

4. **Repeat step 3. for other third-party dependencies that also depend on Polkadot/Substrate/Cumulus**

   If any of the third-party projects we depend on don't yet have a branch or release for the new Polkadot version,
   either wait or fork said project and run step 1 for it and open a PR and point that revision.

   - [`orml` pallets](https://github.com/open-web3-stack/open-runtime-module-library)
   - [`frontier` pallets](https://github.com/moonbeam-foundation/frontier/)
   - [xcm-simulator](https://github.com/shaunxw/xcm-simulator)
   - etc

5. **Build and test the project and migrate any new introduced changes**

   Now that all dependencies are aligned with the latest version of Polkadot, run build and test commands and address
   any compilation issue.

### Troubleshooting

If you face compilation errors like "type X doesn't implement trait Y", and the compiler
doesn't suggest you import any particular trait, experience is that there are different versions
of the Polkadot SDK being pulled; The `cargo patch` rules in `Cargo.toml` should be handling that so if this
still happens it's likely because some new crate of Polkadot SDK or Frontier is being pulled directly or indirectly
and we need to include that crate in the appropriate `cargo patch` rule.
