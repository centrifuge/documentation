# Composability

The Centrifuge protocol has been designed to enable integration with the broader DeFi ecosystem.

Standards that are supported by the protocol include:

* **ERC-20**: issued share tokens, as well as holdings on the balance sheet of a pool.
* **ERC-1404**: standardized compliance checks for share tokens.
* **ERC-2612**: `permit` functionality built in to share tokens.
* **ERC-4626**: tokenized vault standard, used for synchronous deposit vaults.
* **ERC-7540**: asynchronous vault standard, used for asynchronous vault logic.
* **ERC-7575**: multi-asset vault standard, to allow multiple investment assets per share token.
* **ERC-6909**: holdings of multi-tokens on the balance sheet of a pool.
