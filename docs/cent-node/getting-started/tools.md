To get started quickly, we recommend using two services that will make your life easier:

## Infura
In order to interact with Ethereum and the Ethereum testnets you need to install the corresponding node. To get started quickly we recommend that you use Infura instead of hosting your own Ethereum node. Infura is a SaaS platform that provides API and developer tools for easy and secure access to Ethereum. In other words, it is core infrastructure that serves as a gateway to the blockchain. 

Register and create an Infura account here: https://infura.io/. Create a new project. 

## Postman
To be able to manage documents on Centrifuge the user will have to make API calls. You can browser our Postman collection to look at a few examples. Create an account here: https://www.getpostman.com/ and import the [Centrifuge collection](https://www.getpostman.com/collections/828cc6af5bc56642ba42).
