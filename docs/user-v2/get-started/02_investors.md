# Quickstart for Investors

Get started investing in Centrifuge pools.

## Prerequisites

- **Wallet**: An EVM-compatible wallet (e.g., MetaMask, Rabby).
- **Funds**: Stablecoins (e.g., USDC) on a supported chain.
- **Eligibility**: Some pools require KYC/AML verification.

## Steps to Invest

1.  **Find a Pool**
    - Browse available pools on the Centrifuge App.
    - Review the investment terms, asset backing, and expected returns.

2.  **Complete Onboarding (if required)**
    - Some pools require you to be whitelisted.
    - Complete KYC with the pool's identity provider.

3.  **Deposit Funds**
    - Select the pool and the amount you wish to invest.
    - Approve the token spend and confirm the transaction.

4.  **Receive Share Tokens**
    - For **synchronous vaults**, you receive shares immediately.
    - For **asynchronous vaults**, your request is queued. Claim your shares once the request is processed.

5.  **Redeem (when ready)**
    - Submit a redemption request through the app.
    - Claim your underlying assets after processing.
