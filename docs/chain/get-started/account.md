1. Click "Save" and then "Create and backup account". Make sure you save the downloaded JSON file in a safe place.

1. Done! You can now copy your address and send it to others to receive tokens. The address is the string starting with `5...` under the name of your account, e. g. `5HKk5u...wp29Zd` in the following. You can copy it by clicking on the icon to the left of your account name: ![](./account-address.png)


## Getting Testnet Tokens

To run a validator you need to stake Amber Radial (ARAD) or Flint Radial (FRAD) tokens.

Thanks to [BlockXLabs](https://blockxlabs.com/) you can get FRAD testnet tokens for Flint from their [Flint faucet](https://faucets.blockxlabs.com/centrifuge)! (Amber will follow soon — in the meantime ping us on our slack channel).

Once you are ready and need more ARAD/FRAD for staking, please reach out to us at chain@centrifuge.io with your address so we can send you the appropriate amount.
