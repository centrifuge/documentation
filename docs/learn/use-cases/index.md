## Build a Use Case

Welcome to the bonus mission of Discord missions!
Submit a PR to our documentation under this section and provide a potential use case that Centrifuge can tap into, using the following categories:

- **Through the lens of an asset originator**
  - Which markets around the world could benefit most from asset financing through centrifuge?
  -One interesting market is DAO bank. The common pool of funding used to support business like renting properties, staking. For the renting business community owns proportionally the assets like housing ot car which are used to rent them. the revenue is shared proportianally with the individual stake with minus of opperational costs. non tradable NFT can be issued to represent the stake in the pool.   
- **DeFi protocol composability**
  - Centrifuge has started working with MakerDAO and Aave to create instant liquidity for Tinlake pools. What are other great partnership use cases for Centrifuge?
- **Centrifuge Chain (the home for RWA)**
  - Centrifuge Chain is built for RWA origination. Tinlake is a great use case of what can be done with the Centrifuge chain. What are some other cases you can see for the Centrifuge chain?
  - Creating DAO like organization whos operations are controlled by community through governance tokens issued in ruturn community funding. One of example such organization could be the one facilitating validation for various projects. So parts of community funds goes to validation stake of the node. Community decides where and when to buy the required for staking tokens. There are more details to it and expirinced in the art can figure them out.
- **Polkadot**
  - Interoperability is crucial for DeFi’s success. What are some other projects in the Polkadot ecosystem that you think Centrifuge should integrate with?

For any of these categories above 👉 submit a PR to detail how each use case could work. Make sure to think about the entire flow, technology, and size of the potential!
