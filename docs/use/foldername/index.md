## Intro to NFT playground

NFT Playground is a protocol that allows you to view, mint, list, buy and transfer NFT collections.  This is an application built for the community, and it will be a pilot for NFTs on Altair. Ultimately,  this will enable the tokenisation on real world assets to be financed Centrifuge.


## Prerequisite

Before starting, you will need to have some AIR tokens in your Polkadot wallet for the transaction fees on the Altair blockchain. NFT Playground does not charge any additonal fees.

## Connecting to the app
First, go to https://app.altair.network/ and navigate the top right– click on 'Connect'.

The Polkadot JS Wallet will appear, prompting you to authorise NFT playground with access to your wallet, sign the transaction and proceed.

## Creating a Collection
To mint an NFT, you will first have to create a collection for it to live in. To create a collection:
