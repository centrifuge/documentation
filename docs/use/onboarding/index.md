## Introduction
Investing in Centrifuge requires onboarding as an investor to each specific pool. Submitting personal information for KYC and signing a subscription document with the pool's issuer usually takes 5-7 minutes, but it can take 1-2 days when the country of citizenship or country of incorporation is not supported by the automated onboarding.

**Onboard as investor:** Onboarding as an investor is a one-time step to verify personal information for KYC ("Know your customer") through the Centrifuge onboarding flow powered by [Shufti Pro](https://shuftipro.com/). Once an investor is onboarded, they are eligible to invest in any open pool.

**Onboard to a pool:** Onboarding to a pool requires signing a subscription agreement with the pool issuer. Once the agreement has been signed by both parties, and the issuer approves the investment request, the investor can place an investment into the pool. 

## Requirements

### Onboarding as an individual requires:

* Valid email address
* A passport or government-issued photo ID
* Proof of address (e.g. utility bill, phone bill or council tax bill, not older than 3 months)

### Onboarding as an entity requires:

* Due to US sanctions, investors from certain countries are excluded from investing. See section **Excluded Countries** below.

### Onboarding as an US investor

To invest in Centrifuge as an US investor you need to be an "Accredited Investor".

#### What is an "Accredited Investor"?
An accredited investor is an individual or a business entity that is allowed to trade securities that may not be registered with financial authorities such as the SEC. They are entitled to this privileged access by satisfying certain requirements regarding their income, net worth, asset size, governance status or professional experience. In the U.S, the definition of an accredited investor is put forth by [SEC in Rule 501 of Regulation D](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-17/chapter-II/part-230/subject-group-ECFR6e651a4c86c0174/section-230.501).

The regulations for accredited investors vary from between jurisdictions but require that a person:

- Any natural person who had an individual income in excess of $200,000 in each of the two most recent years or joint income with that person's spouse or spousal equivalent in excess of $300,000 in each of those years and has a reasonable expectation of reaching the same income level in the current year; 
- Be a general partner, executive officer, or director for the company that is issuing the unregistered securities or
