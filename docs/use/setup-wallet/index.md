A Centrifuge Chain address can be created through [Polkadot.js website](hhttps://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/explorer), the [Polkadot.js browser extension](https://polkadot.js.org/extension/), or through [Parity Signer](https://www.parity.io/signer/).

**Note that Ledger currently does not support Centrifuge Chain (CFG)**

## Using the Polkadot.js website
**Of all options, this is the least secure and is not recommended.**

1. Open Polkadot.js[https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/explorer]
2. Click the dropdown at the top left and select Centrifuge (listed under "Polkadot & Parachains")

   Fill in the form, e. g. for Peter Parker: ![](./images/create-account.png)

4. Click "Save" and then "Create and backup account". Make sure you save the downloaded JSON file in a safe place.

5. Done! You can now copy your address and send it to others to receive tokens. The address is the string starting with `4...` (for Centrifuge Mainnet). You can copy it by clicking on the icon to the left of your account name: ![](./images/account-address.png)

## Using the Polkadot.js extension

1. Download the extension [here](https://polkadot.js.org/extension/)
1. Create a new account by clicking on "+" in the top right of the extension and selecting "Create new account"

### How to Generate an Address Using Parity Signer

1. Buy an old or new device (ex. iPod touch, Android phone, etc.)
     - **Important:** only charge it with a battery bank or wall charger, **donâ€™t plug it into a computer!!!** Use a charge only cable, not a data cable.
2. Set up a passcode and set it to wipe the device upon entering the code incorrectly too many times.
3. Install the [Parity Signer App](https://www.parity.io/signer/) from below links:
     - [Link for Apple device](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/parity-signer/id1218174838)
     - [Link for Android device](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.parity.signer)
4. Never connect the the device to a computer, even to upgrade it.
5. Turn off WiFi & Bluetooth (**NEVER TURN IT ON AGAIN!**)
6. Create a key for Centrifuge Mainnet using the Parity Signer App
     - Create your identity to get started

       ![](./images/new-identity.png#width=400)
     - Write down your 24 word Recovery Phrase (**THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT**)

       ![](./images/recovery-phrase.png#width=400)
     - Set your Identity PIN
       - **You will use this PIN to sign all of your transactions using this device.**
     - Create your first Keypair - select the Centrifuge Mainnet Network
       ![](./images/create-keypair.png#width=400)
7. Get your address by scanning the QR code on the Polkadot.js website.
     - On your computer, navigate to https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/explorer
     - Make sure the network is set to Centrifuge.
     - Click on Accounts
     - Click on 'Add via QR'
       ![](./images/add-via-qr.png#width=400)
     - Scan the QR code on your device for your Centrifuge Mainnet Public Address
       ![](./images/public-address-qr.png#width=400)
     - Your address for Centrifuge Mainnet should begin with a '4...'
1. To manually check the above process:
     - Delete the key from the app
     - Recover the key from your backed up phrase
     - Verify the address matches what you obtained above

1) Send some test CFG to another address and use Parity Signer to sign this transaction
     - You will first need to send some CFG to this account
     - Initiate a transfer on the Polkadot.js website by selecting 'Transfer' in the left menu or on 'Send' from the Accounts page
     - Click 'Make Transfer'
     - Click 'Sign via QR'
     - Using the Parity Signer App, scan the QR code in your browser with the App's QR Scanner from this account screen (see above on how to get it).
     - In the app, confirm your signature of the transaction by entering your PIN
     - Click 'Scan Signature QR' in the browser
     - Sign the transaction

1) Backup your Recovery Phrase and keep it somewhere safe. Please do research on secure methods for storage and recovery.

> **A note on app updates:**
> If a new version of the app becomes available, please exercise the following caution.
> Ideally, replace the device or do not update the app.
> If an update is necessary:
>
> 1.  Hard reset the device and wipe everything
> 2.  Re-install the new parity signer app
> 3.  Turn off wifi & bluetooth and **NEVER TURN IT ON AGAIN**
> 4.  Recover your key from seed phrase
