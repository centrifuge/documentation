A Centrifuge Chain address can be created through the [Centrifuge Portal](https://portal.chain.centrifuge.io/#/accounts), the [Polkadot browser extension](https://polkadot.js.org/extension/), or through [Parity Signer](https://www.parity.io/signer/).

## Using the Portal UI
**Of all options, this is the least secure and is not recommended.**

1. Open the Portal at https://portal.chain.centrifuge.io/#?rpc=wss://fullnode.centrifuge.io
1. Create a new account for your user by navigating to "Accounts" and clicking "Add account".

   Fill in the form, e. g. for Peter Parker: ![](./images/create-account.png)

1. Click "Save" and then "Create and backup account". Make sure you save the downloaded JSON file in a safe place.

1. Done! You can now copy your address and send it to others to receive tokens. The address is the string starting with `4...` for Mainnet or `5...` for Amber or Flint under the name of your account, e. g. `5HKk5u...wp29Zd` in the following. You can copy it by clicking on the icon to the left of your account name: ![](./images/account-address.png)

## Using the Polkadot.js extension

1. Download the extension [here](https://polkadot.js.org/extension/)
1. Create a new account by clicking on "+" in the top right of the extension and selecting "Create new account"

### How to Generate an Address Using Parity Signer

1. Buy an old or new device (ex. ipod touch, android phone, etc.)
     - **Important** only charge it with a battery bank or wall charger, **don’t plug it into a computer!!!** Use a charge only cable, not a data cable.
1. Set up a passcode and set it to wipe the device upon entering the code incorrectly too many times.
1. Install the [Parity Signer App](https://www.parity.io/signer/) from below links:

     - [Link for android device](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.parity.signer)
1. Never connect the the device to a computer, even to upgrade it.
1. Turn off wifi & bluetooth (**NEVER TURN IT ON AGAIN!**)

1. To manually check the above process:
     - Delete the key from the app
     - Recover the key from your backed up phrase
     - Verify the address matches what you obtained above

     - Click 'Make Transfer'

## How to Use your Ledger with Centrifuge
This is a tutorial on how to use your [Ledger device](https://www.ledger.com) to manage your Centrifuge (CFG) tokens on Centrifuge Chain. The Ledger device is a hardware wallet made specifically for managing crypto assets, making it one of the most secure ways to manage your crypto assets. [Parity Signer](https://github.com/paritytech/parity-signer), described above, is an alternate hardware wallet; however, unlike the Ledger, it uses a device that is not specifically designed to manage crypto assets. Read more about other ways to create your account on Centrifuge above.
