## Setting up Metamask
### What is Metamask?
MetaMask is a browser extension that allows you to use Ethereum Protocols or `dApps` ("decentralized Apps") such as Tinlake right in your browser. Metamask holds your private keys, and once it's set up, you can connect it to the dApp in your browser and confirm your transactions in the dApp with Metamask. It also serves as a wallet for ETH and `ERC20 tokens`, such as DAI, TIN or DROP and allows you to transfer and receive such tokens.

### How to install Metamask in your browser
1. Go to https://metamask.io/download.html.
2. Choose the browser you want to use.
3. You will be directed to corresponding web store.
4. Follow the steps there to add the extension to your browser.
5. After setting up your wallet, Metamask should pop-up as a Fox icon ![](https://storage.googleapis.com/centrifuge-hackmd/upload_7dd07df8a7fc7d1b29743ec9535dbba7.png =20x) in your browser bar.

## Set up a Ledger Hardware Wallet
### How to use Metamask with a hardware wallet, e.g. Ledger?
A hardware wallet stores the user's private keys in a secure hardware device. To use an address/wallet stored on a hard ware wallet a user needs to be in physical posession of this hardware wallet. Popolar hardware wallets are e.g [Ledger](https://www.ledger.com/) or [Trezor](https://trezor.io/).

#### Set up the Ledger
Download the [Ledger Live App](https://www.ledger.com/ledger-live/) and follow the steps in the App also described [here]( https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/360018784134) to set up you Ledger.

### Install Ethereum App on Ledger Device
1. Open the Manager in Ledger Live.
2. Connect and unlock your device.
3. If asked, allow the manager on your device.
4. Find Ethereum in the app catalog.
5. Click the Install button of the app.
    - An installation window appears
    - Your device will display `Processing...`
    - The app installation is confirmed

### Configure Ethereum App 

1. Open the Ethereum App Settings.
2. Change Contract Data to `Yes`.
3. [OPTIONAL] For older versions of Ledger, make sure Browser Support is set to `Yes`. Newer Ledger Versions are supporting it by default. 

### Connect Hardware Wallet in Metamask
1. Open Metamask by clicking on the fox icon.
2. Make sure to select the correct network (`Main Ethereum Network` or `Kovan Test Network`) at the top.
3. Click on the circle in the top right corner.
4. Click on `Connect Hardware Wallet`.
5. A new modal opens. Select `Ledger` and click `Connect`.
6. Select address you would like to use. Your Ledger already entails several addresses you can chose from (autogenerated for you).

### Confirm transactions with your hardware wallet (Ledger/Trezor)
When your Metamask account is connected to your hardware wallet then you need to confirm each transaction with the ledger. 

- Connect ledger with your computer.
- Issue the transaction.
- Confirm transaction with hardware wallet.
