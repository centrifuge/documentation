    - [Wallet Connect](https://walletconnect.com/)


If you are setting up a wallet for the first time please apply appropriate security measures when setting up your web3 wallet. Find more information how to set up a web3 wallet [here](/use/setup-wallet/).

When attempting to invest, ensure you are connected with the wallet address you connected with during the initial KYC process to invest in a pool. If you encounter an issue please confirm KYC has been completed and that the correct wallet is selected. If issue remains please contact support@centrifuge.io.

## Fund Investment address

Before you invest, please make sure that your KYCed investment address is funded with both the investment amount in the stablecoin of the selected pool and sufficient native chain currency (such as ETH or CFG) to pay for the transaction fees. There are [several centralized and decentralized exchanges](https://cointelegraph.com/ethereum-for-beginners/how-to-buy-ethereum), such as [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/) or [Uniswap](https://uniswap.org/) where you can buy and/or trade ETH and Stablecoins against USD and other tokens.

# Investment flow summary

Investments and redemptions on Centrifuge are executed in epochs. During an epoch you can lock your investment or redemption order. You can also cancel your locked order during an epoch period. At the end of an epoch all locked orders automatically executed at best effort considering investment/redemption supply and demand and the pool's risk metrics such as minim tranche risk buffers. 

Once an investment is executed, the  tranche tokens (in the case of an investment) or stable coin (in the case of a redemption) at any time following the start of the next epoch. If your order only partially executes you can collect that portion of your order. The unfulfilled part of the order remains locked for investment/redemption pending execution. As with your initial order, this lock can be canceled at any time.

## Step-by-step investment guide

### Navigate to [app.centrifuge.io/pools](https://app.centrifuge.io/pools)
### Connect your wallet 
- Connect your investment wallet to the app by clicking "Connect" in the top right corner (if you do not see a "Connect Button", try to either expand your screen or look on the bottom of the page). Please ensure the connected wallet is the same wallet used during the KYC process.
