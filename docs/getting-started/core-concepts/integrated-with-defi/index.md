# Integrated with DeFi

Currently, most DeFi (decentralized finance) applications are limited to their respective blockchain ecosystem. Bridges between chains exist but using them is cumbersome and expensive with the need to set up different tools and swap several tokens.

Centrifuge Protocol provides Liquidity pools that allow for direct integration with any general purpose EVM blockchain. By creating a standard layer to invest in Centrifuge pools this minimizes the effort required to integrate a new EVM based chain.

## Liquidity Pools
Using Liquidity pools, integrations could be used to enable protocols to invest in real world assets. Stablecoin protocols such as MakerDAO could invest into the pools that they want. This could allow issuers to access deeper liquidity without having to integrate all these DeFi sources of liquidity and new end user markets themselves.

While the Centrifuge Protocol is built on Substrate, interacting with the Centrifuge Protocol would be possible from multiple chains creating a true multi-chain ecosystem.
