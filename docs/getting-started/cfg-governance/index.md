# The Centrifuge Governance

Centrifuge has evolved its structure to accelerate RWA adoption, boost transparency, and drive CFG value accrual.

Per [CP171](https://github.com/centrifuge/cps/blob/main/cps/cp171.md), approved by CFG DAO token holders on October 30, 2025, active DAO governance has paused, shifting execution to a streamlined model under Centrifuge Network Foundation supervision.

This change enables agility in the fast-evolving RWA space while keeping CFG holders in control of the protocol. The DAO tools remain paused but available for potential reactivation.

### Roles & Focus

| Entity | Role | Focus |
|---|---|---|
| **Centrifuge Network Foundation (CNF)** | Board-led oversight; manages treasury and assets transferred from DAO; ensures all actions grow protocol adoption and value | Long-term value accrual; protocol sustainability |
| **Centrifuge Labs** | CNF subsidiary handling operations | Product development; partnerships; marketing; revenue |
| **CFG Holders & Community** | Retain ultimate stewardship and control of the Centrifuge protocol; drive engagement through local activations; events; grassroots initiatives | Empower community-driven long-term value accrual; ensure protocol sustainability through stewardship, innovation, and adoption efforts |

## Reinstatement Process

Active DAO governance is paused. Execution now follows a streamlined model under the supervision of the Centrifuge Network Foundation. Token holders retain ultimate control of the protocol and can propose reinstating the DAO to transfer power back. 

**Process for reactivating the DAO:**

- Create a forum post with a complete proposal description following the [CP0](https://github.com/centrifuge/cps/tree/main/cps/CP0) template.
- After 14 days of discussion, submit the final proposal on [GitHub](https://github.com/centrifuge/cps/tree/main/cps).
- Initiate a 7-day Snapshot vote.
- Notify all token holders through available media channels.
- The off-chain vote requires a quorum of at least 4,000,000 CFG.
