# Welcome to Centrifuge

Centrifuge is the open, institutional-grade infrastructure powering onchain asset management. As one of the first and largest tokenization platforms, Centrifuge connects traditional capital markets to onchain liquidity; enabling asset managers, fintechs, and DeFi protocols to launch compliant tokenized funds in weeks, not months.

Today, Centrifuge powers onchain strategies for leading institutions including Apollo, Janus Henderson, and S&P Dow Jones Indices, while its tokenized assets integrate deeply across DeFi through protocols such as Sky, Aave, and Morpho. More than $2B in real-world assets have already been tokenized through the platform, supported by 21+ audits, deployments on 7 chains, and a proven security record. 

Centrifuge is designed to make launching and operating tokenized funds simple, fast, and institution-ready:
* **Launch in weeks**: Pre-built components for tokenization, onboarding, NAV, and multi-chain distribution remove the heavy engineering lift.
* **Extend with SDK & API**: Build custom frontends, automate operations, or integrate Centrifuge data into your systems.
* **Native DeFi compatibility**: ERC-4626 and ERC-7540 assets integrate seamlessly with Maker, Aave Horizon, Morpho, Pendle, and more.
