# Welcome to Centrifuge

Centrifuge is the open, institutional-grade infrastructure powering onchain asset management. As one of the first and largest tokenization platforms, Centrifuge connects traditional capital markets to onchain liquidity; enabling asset managers, fintechs, and DeFi protocols to launch compliant tokenized funds in weeks, not months.

Today, Centrifuge powers onchain strategies for leading institutions including Apollo, Janus Henderson, and S&P Dow Jones Indices, while its tokenized assets integrate deeply across DeFi through protocols such as Sky, Aave, and Morpho. More than $2B in real-world assets have already been tokenized through the platform, supported by 21+ audits, deployments on 7 chains, and a proven security record. 

Centrifuge is designed to make launching and operating tokenized funds simple, fast, and institution-ready:

* *Launch in weeks, not months*: Centrifuge provides pre-built components for tokenization, investor onboarding, NAV workflows, and multi-chain distribution—eliminating the engineering burden that typically slows launches.
* *Compliance built in*: Issuers can configure modular KYC, AML, whitelisting, and blacklisting tools to match their regulatory requirements. Compliance checks and transfer controls are enforced at the protocol level.
* *Build on top with SDKs and APIs*: Developers can extend the platform by integrating the Centrifuge SDK, building custom frontends, automating processes, or piping fund data into internal systems using the API.
* *Deep DeFi interoperability*: Assets issued through Centrifuge use widely adopted standards like ERC-4626 and ERC-7540, enabling seamless integrations with major protocols such as Maker, Aave Horizon, Morpho, Pendle, and others.
* *Security you can rely on*: With 21+ completed audits, an immutable core architecture, and years of production operation, Centrifuge offers battle-tested infrastructure trusted by institutions.

Centrifuge also advances the broader ecosystem through the [Real-World Asset Summit](https://www.rwasummit.io/), the [Tokenized Vault Foundation](https://vault.foundation/), and the [Tokenized Asset Coalition](https://tacoalition.org/), helping set the standards for the next generation of onchain finance.
