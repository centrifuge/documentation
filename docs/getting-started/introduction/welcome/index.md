# Welcome to Centrifuge

Centrifuge is the pioneering platform for real-world asset tokenization. Through Centrifuge, investors gain access to a diverse range of assets, improving transparency and achieving better insight into their portfolio. Asset managers tokenize their funds and streamline access to necessary service providers and investors, saving cost for fund operations and unlocking new sources of capital.

Centrifuge provides both the infrastructure and ecosystem to tokenize, manage, and invest into a complete, diversified portfolio of real-world assets.

Asset pools are fully collateralized, investors have legal recourse, and the protocol is asset-class agnostic with pools for assets spanning structured credit, real estate, US treasuries, carbon credits, consumer finance, and more.

Centrifuge's ecosystem extends beyond its onchain financial infrastructure, incorporating a DAO (decentralized autonomous organization) supported by a diverse community of finance professionals and developers.

By bringing the entire structured credit market onchain across securitization, tokenization, privacy, governance, and liquidity integrations, Centrifuge is building a more transparent, affordable, and limitless financial system.

In these docs, you'll find everything you need to know about Centrifuge; from basic concepts to user guides to developer documentation. Here's a rundown of the three sections:
