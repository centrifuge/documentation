# Security Overview

Centrifuge treats security as an operational requirement across the entire stack — protocol, application, and infrastructure. Since launching on mainnet in 2019, the platform has maintained a zero-exploit track record backed by 24+ independent security reviews from firms including Spearbit, Blackthorn, and SRLabs.

The protocol codebase is fully immutable, with emergency functions locked behind a 48-hour timelock.
